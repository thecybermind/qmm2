**QMM** is a plugin manager for games based on the Quake 3 engine. It functions similar to [Metamod](http://metamod.org/) for Half-Life and [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/) for the Source engine (Half-Life 2).

[How it works](https://github.com/thecybermind/qmm2/wiki/How-QMM-works): It hooks communication between the server engine and the game logic (the mod). It allows for plugins to be loaded in-between which can add or change functionality without having to change the mod itself.

It supports native DLL/SO mods as well as [QVM](https://github.com/thecybermind/qmm2/wiki/QVM) mods with a complete built-in bytecode virtual machine interpreter.

Check out some plugins at the [Plugin List wiki page](https://github.com/thecybermind/qmm2/wiki/Plugin-List).
